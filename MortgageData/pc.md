## Recommendation

**Wait until February 2026** to remortgage.

### Reasons:
1. **Significant exit fee reduction:** Save £1,298 by waiting 6 months
2. **Minimal net cost:** Only £190 extra in interest over 6 months
3. **Market outlook:** Bank of England expected to cut rates further (August and November 2025)
4. **Risk management:** More time to assess market conditions

### Action Timeline:

#### Now - November 2025
- Monitor rates through broker/comparison sites
- Watch Bank of England decisions (August 7 & November meetings)
- Gather necessary documents

#### December 2025
- Begin formal mortgage research
- Get Agreement in Principle from lenders
- Instruct mortgage broker

#### January 2026
- Submit formal applications
- Lock in best available rate (offers valid 3-6 months)

#### February 2026
- Complete remortgage after ERC drops to 2%
- Estimated new monthly payment: ~£905
- Monthly savings: ~£248

## Key Considerations

1. **Rate risk:** If rates rise unexpectedly, the £190 cost of waiting is minimal insurance
2. **Property value:** Consider getting an updated valuation - higher value = lower LTV = better rates
3. **Overpayments:** Check if you can make penalty-free overpayments (usually 10% annually)
4. **Green mortgages:** You may qualify for better rates if your property has EPC rating A or B

## Summary

Your current 5.39% rate is significantly above market rates (3.75-3.90%). While you could save £248/month by switching now, waiting 6 months until February 2026 reduces your exit penalty from £3,678 to £2,380 - a saving that far outweighs the extra interest paid. With potential further rate cuts on the horizon, February 2026 presents the optimal remortgage window.
