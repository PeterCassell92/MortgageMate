# MortgageMate

A Tool for helping users decide upon optimal mortgage options.

I made this simply because I found Claude's mortgage advice useful to myself but it took me knowing how to use Claude well to design the right prompt. Idea of this project is

## A) To be a vibe code playground.

This project does not matter. It is just for make good features with vibe code. The app may ultimately be somewhat useful but it isn't really needed - there are many mortgage tools in this world.

## B) To make an application with usage of the Anthropic API

To understand API integrations for Anthropic at a small-scale.

## C) To get good at prompt engineering.

The app gets data from the user until it has enough information to go off to Anthropic API and reason for the best mortgage options from your current position. We want to use rules-based coding to create good LLM prompts, a principle that applies more broadly to apps we are interested in building.
